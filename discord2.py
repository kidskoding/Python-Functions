def function(fruit): #we pass information into functions called arguments or parameters
  print(fruit + " juice") #I ask the terminal to print the argument fruit and juice
function("orange") #fruit in this case is orange so what the terminal is going to do is that it will substitute orange with fruit and will give orange juice with a space in between
#I included that space in between orange and juice by adding a space between quotation mark and juice in between
