def function(): #this right here defines the function by using the def keyword. I set a name for the function which was simply function and the two parentheses tell the terminal its a function. 
  print("A function") #anything inside the function is what the terminal will display. In this scenario, the terminal will display A function  
function() #this calls the function. Functions will only work when you call them.
